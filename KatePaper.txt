Abstract
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives Califor-nia residents the right to opt out of the 
sale or sharing of their personal information via Global Privacy Control (GPC). In this study we 
show how to evaluate websites’ compliance with GPC. Using longitudinal data collected by crawling a 
set of 11,708 sites, we show the extent to which sites are respect-ing California residents’ opt 
out rights expressed via GPC. We do so by examining the values of four privacy strings that 
indicate a web user’s opt out status: the US Privacy String, the Global Privacy Platform String, 
the OptanonConsent cookie, and the .wellknown/gpc.json. We find that about a third of sites that 
have evidence of selling or sharing personal informa-tion per the CCPA implement at least one of 
the four privacy strings. In December 2023, 44% (1,411/3,226) of such sites opted users out via all 
implemented privacy strings. In Febru-ary 2024, this percentage decreased to 43% (1,473/3,402) 
before increasing to 45% (1,620/3,566) in April 2024. De-spite the slight uptick between December 
2023 and April 2024, compliance rates remained at a low level overall, in-dicating widespread 
disregard for California residents’ right to opt out. Our findings highlight the importance of 
effective enforcement of the CCPA, in particular, with a focus on big web publishers.

1 Introduction
In 2018 the California State Legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) giving 
California residents the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information 
[74]. They can exercise their opt out right via Global Privacy Control (GPC) [82, 83, 84, 85, 86]. 
This bi-nary privacy preference signal can be implemented via an HTTP header or a JavaScript DOM 
property. The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) requires that businesses

subject to the CCPA honor “user-enabled global privacy con-trol, like the GPC” as a valid opt out 
request, and the Office of the California Attorney General (OAG) enforces this require-ment [75]. A 
growing number of browsers, including Brave, DuckDuckGo, and Firefox, now natively support GPC.
When a first party website receives a GPC signal, it must propagate this preference to its 
integrated third parties, if any. This propagation is done using privacy strings. The first party 
updates any implemented privacy strings based on the user’s preferences, and all integrated third 
parties are required to modify their behavior accordingly. For instance, site operators can 
propagate a user’s preferences to third parties via the US Privacy String (USPS) [40], a privacy 
string provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), an ad industry organiza-tion, that 
specifically supports CCPA requirements [39]. As of January 31, 2024, the IAB deprecated the USPS 
and replaced it with the Global Privacy Platform (GPP) String, which sup-ports requirements for 
multiple US state laws and laws in other jurisdictions [33]. Sites that integrate OneTrust [60], a 
Consent Management Platform (CMP) that provides web and app compliance libraries, can set 
isGpcEnabled in the OptanonConsent cookie. Also, site operators can include a
.well-known/gpc.json resource on their site to indicate to the public that it supports GPC [85]. We 
will collectively refer to the set of USPS, GPP String, OptanonConsent cookie, and
.well-known/gpc.json as privacy strings.¹
In this study, we show how to evaluate websites’ compli-ance with the CCPA opt out right expressed 
via GPC and based on the propagation of privacy strings to third parties. In particular, we are 
addressing the following research questions:

RQ1. CCPA Opt Out Right Applicability: How do we identify sites subject to the CCPA opt out right?
RQ2. GPC Compliance Implementation: How do we iden-tify sites’ compliance with the CCPA opt out 
right when receiving GPC signals at scale and over time?
                                                 
1See Appendix A.1 for background information on GPC and privacy strings. See Appendix A.3 for 
relevant CCPA definitions in the context of this study.

RQ3. GPC Compliance Evaluation: To which extent do sites indicate that they respect GPC? How does 
GPC compliance on the web change over time?
RQ4. Transition from USPS to GPP: Are sites that imple-ment the IAB’s USPS transitioning to GPP?
RQ5. Recommendation for Regulators: How can regula-tors improve GPC compliance?
To answer these questions we implemented a web crawler based on the Selenium WebDriver [73], which 
we used to visit 11,708 sites and which instrumented our browser exten-sion to determine if a site 
is subject to the CCPA and, if so, respects GPC signals. We based our browser extension on the 
OptMeowt extension in analysis mode [65], as described and implemented by Zimmeck et al. [86]. We 
collected three lon-gitudinal snapshots — in December 2023, February 2024, and April 2024 — a time 
period which coincides with the IAB’s transition from the USPS to the GPP String. After discussing 
the background and related work of our study (§2) and how we constructed our crawl set of 11,708 
sites (§3.1), we make the following contributions:
• We develop a methodology for identifying CCPA opt out right applicability to websites based on 
their amount of web traffic and integration of third party libraries that collect, buy, sell, or 
share personal information. (RQ1: §3.2.)
• We design and implement a web crawler and browser ex-tension to identify sites’ GPC compliance by 
sending GPC signals and detecting the presence of privacy strings, their values, and changes of 
their values, each with high accuracy. (RQ2: §3.3 to §3.6.)
• Despite a slight uptick, the overall compliance level re-mained low for our observation period. 
In December 2023, 44% (1,411/3,226) of sites that sell or share personal infor-mation per the CCPA 
and that implement at least one of the four privacy strings opted users out via all implemented 
pri-vacy strings. In February 2024, this percentage decreased to 43% (1,473/3,402) before 
increasing to 45% (1,620/3,566) in April 2024. (RQ3: §4.1 and §4.2.)
• GPP adoption rose markedly at the time of USPS depreca-tion and then slowed down substantially. 
(RQ4: §4.2.3.)
• Our main recommendation for regulators is to focus en-forcement on big web publishers. For 
example, instances of inconsistent opt outs resulting from multiple implemented privacy strings are 
often related to a few big publishers. Further, as big publishers tend to roll out the same privacy 
strings to all of their sites, improved compliance will result in broad impact. (RQ5: §4.3, §4.4, 
and §5.)

2 Background and Related Work
Our study is motivated by the lack of compliance with the CCPA (§2.1) for opting out from web 
tracking (§2.2). GPC and other privacy preference signals can help users to exercise
their opt out rights (§2.3). Thus, we seek to analyze websites’ compliance with GPC at scale and 
over time (§2.4).

2.1 The CCPA and its Evolution
The CCPA grants California residents, among others, the rights to (1) know what personal 
information businesses col-lect about them, (2) have deleted the personal information that was 
collected, (3) opt out of the sale or sharing of per-sonal information, and (4) not be 
discriminated against for exercising CCPA rights [74]. Originally, the CCPA applied to businesses 
that (A) have an annual revenue of at least twenty-five million dollars, (B) collect the personal 
information of 50,000 or more consumers, or (C) derive more than half of their annual revenue from 
selling personal information [76]. Any business that sold or shared personal information was 
required to “[p]rovide a clear and conspicuous link on [its] Internet homepage, titled ‘Do Not Sell 
My Personal Infor-mation”’ (DNSL) where the consumer can exercise the opt out right [76]. Under the 
CCPA, “sale” is defined as trans-ferring personal information “for monetary or other valuable 
consideration” (CCPA, §1798.140(ad)(1)). “Sharing” is de-fined as transferring personal information 
“for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable 
consideration” (CCPA, §1798.140(ah)(1)).²
In 2020, Californians voted to amend the CCPA through the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). 
While this amend-ment modified the CCPA in a variety of ways, there are two changes that are of 
particular interest for our purposes. First, the CPRA reduced the scope of businesses to which the 
CCPA applies by increasing the threshold in part (B) of the original “business” definition to 
100,000 or more consumers (CCPA,
§1798.140(d)(1)(B)). Second, the CPRA exempted businesses from the DNSL requirement if they respect 
automated opt out signals (CCPA, §1798.135(b)(1)). Additionally, this amend-ment created the CPPA 
to enforce the CCPA. The CPRA became operative January 1, 2023, and enforcement began on March 29, 
2024.

2.2 Opting Out from Web Tracking
Despite the CCPA’s rights opting out from web tracking re-mains a challenge for users and is 
difficult to enforce for regulators. Many websites use tracking cookies first and ask for consent 
later [79]. Invisible tracking pixels are commonly used by third parties [23, 69]. The ads that 
appear on sites can be related to various personal attributes and potentially even lead to 
discrimination [17]. While more recent approaches of ad personalization are more 
privacy-preserving, e.g., the Topics API by Google has better privacy compared to track-ing cookies 
[1], interest-disclosing mechanisms are generally privacy-exposing and not -preserving [5]. For 
users it is dif-ficult to gain control over their data. Privacy controls and
2Full legal definitions are included in Appendix §A.3.

opt out choices can vary significantly and confuse users even when they want to have more privacy 
[28].
User-friendly design for privacy notice and choice interac-tions has been studied to help improve 
the usage of choice mechanisms [26, 27, 71, 84]. Browser extensions can help users to opt out by 
automatically clicking on opt out links [3] or cookie opt out buttons [42]. From the sites’ 
perspective, CMPs can help streamline privacy controls [70]. To propagate users’ CCPA opt out 
choices from first parties to third parties and among third parties the IAB developed GPP as part 
of the IAB CCPA Compliance Framework [36]. However, various adoption and implementation issues 
limit users’ opt outs from being honored by third parties [2]. While laws and regula-tions were 
found to have some effect, e.g., the introduction of the GDPR lowered the amount of third party 
cookies and tracking [45], regulators currently do not have any mechanism to audit ad networks’ 
compliance with user consent, i.e., to determine if ad networks indeed do not collect, process, and 
share user data when users opt out [46].

2.3  GPC and other Privacy Preference Signals
Privacy preference signals hold the promise of helping users to efficiently and effectively 
exercise their opt out rights. How-ever, their adoption represents a coordination problem dating 
back to the 1990s [31]. The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P) was an early effort to 
help people understand and make privacy choices automatically based on machine-readable privacy 
policies [14, 15]. Its complexity and the lack of adoption of machine-readable privacy policies 
lead to the development of Do Not Track (DNT) [21], a simple binary signal for people to express 
their opt out of tracking per the California Online Privacy Protection Act [9]. However, DNT 
adoption remained low as there was no legal obligation for signal recipients to comply with DNT; 
only to say whether they comply [9]. Learning from previous experiences GPC aims to be a 
technologically practical and legally enforceable opt out mechanism [85]. GPC is not limited to the 
CCPA but could also be applied in the EU [4]. Competent Data Protec-tion Authorities or the Court 
of Justice of the EU could clarify how GPC should be interpreted under EU law [16].
Our study is based on various previous GPC studies. One study has shown that most users understand 
what they declare by turning on GPC and that they would do so in larger num-bers if GPC were 
supported by their browser [86]. In addition, websites and their integrated third parties would 
also need to adopt GPC functionality. At the time of the study [86], August 2022, only 12% of sites 
respected GPC signals, which sub-stantially increased per our findings in this study. At that time, 
the applicability of the CCPA was determined by the pres-ence of a DNSL, an approach that no longer 
works as DNSLs are not mandated anymore under the CCPA as amended by the CPRA (CCPA, §1798.135(b)). 
While nearly a quarter of the top 25,000 Tranco sites [64] that had a DNSL before the
CPRA took effect no longer support any opt out mechanism, the number of sites that respect GPC 
signals increased from November 2022 to November 2023 [11]. By measuring CCPA compliance based on 
DNSLs and determining CCPA appli-cability via a combination of unique visitor count estimates and 
detection of embedded ad networks using resource inclu-sion trees another study showed that DNSLs 
were much more prevalent in the top 25,000 Tranco sites than in lower-ranked sites. In general, as 
the CCPA is evolving there is a positive spillover effect of the CCPA opt out requirements to 
states with weaker or no privacy laws [78]. In this sense, GPC may reach beyond jurisdictions that 
formally adopt it.

2.4 Website Compliance Analysis
In this study we evaluate websites’ compliance with GPC. Generally, website compliance with legal 
requirements can be evaluated based on various browser automation tools [20, 25, 51]. We 
implemented a web crawler using a Selenium WebDriver [73] and Firefox Nightly instance [55]. We 
iden-tify trackers with Firefox’s built-in Enhanced Tracking Pro-tection [54], which identifies 
tracker URLs and exposes an API that categorizes the trackers based on the Disconnect list [19]. In 
addition to websites’ compliance with GPC, pre-vious work evaluated compliance with EU cookie laws, 
focus-ing on consent requests, and found various infractions [10]. A number of sites registered 
positive consent without user choice, nudged users with pre-selected options, or ignored explicit 
opt outs [47]. While a significant number of sites adjusted their privacy policies as the GDPR 
became effective, the functionality and usability of opt out mechanisms saw less improvement [18]. 
Thus, compliance problems under both the GDPR and CCPA continue to persist [81].

3 Methodology and Application
We constructed a crawl set of 11,708 sites (§3.1) and evaluated the applicability of the CCPA opt 
out right for each site (§3.2). Our evaluation methodology is based on detecting changes in privacy 
strings that sites send to integrated third parties after receiving a GPC signal (§3.3). We 
implemented this methodology in a browser extension that runs on a Selenium web crawler (§3.4) and 
evaluated its accuracy for detecting sites’ compliance with GPC (§3.5). This approach is subject to 
various limitations (§3.6).

3.1 Constructing the Crawl Set
We started the construction of our set of sites to crawl (the crawl set) using BuiltWith [8], a 
lead generation service that identifies sites integrating certain technologies, such as GPC, USPS, 
or a certain ad network.³ We identified sites potentially
3While BuiltWith identifies sites with GPC or USPS, its detection mecha-nism is shallow, 
essentially, only detecting whether a site contains any GPC-

subject to the CCPA due to their integration of technologies that are likely involved in the 
selling or sharing of personal information (§3.2.1). We used the Selenium WebDriver [73] to scrape 
BuiltWith’s free preview for United States sites with GPC [6], USPS [7], or a popular ad network 
from the Disconnect list [19]. We ran the scrape between October 11 and November 3, 2023. We 
scraped sites from BuiltWith that:
1. Have GPC code or
2. Have USPS code or
3. Use Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Google, Automattic, Tik-Tok, Microsoft, MailChimp, Akamai, 
OptinMonster, or Criteo. We chose the ad networks in the following way:
(a) Begin with all ad network URLs in the Advertising section of the Disconnect list, filtered for 
.com, .net,
.org, .info, .biz, .mobi, .us, .services, .xyz, .tech, .co,
.tv, .works, .pro, .online, .media, .space, .io, and .html.
(b) Sort the ad network URLs by how many server do-main names they have on the Disconnect list as a 
proxy for prevalence to maximize crawl set coverage.
(c) If the ad network has more than 5 server domain names, manually search BuiltWith for its name.
(d) If the ad network has up to 5 server domain names, automate the search on BuiltWith by changing 
spaces in the ad network name to “-”, concatenate the new name to https://trends.builtwith.com/ 
ads/, and load each resulting URL using Selenium.
(e) For each search per (c) and (d) collect the USA Live sites number from their BuiltWith site.
(f) Sort the ad networks by how many USA Live sites each has. Pick the 11 highest-ranked ad 
networks.
To identify all sites on BuiltWith using GPC, USPS, or ad network technologies, we constructed URLs 
by concatenating each of the following base URLs and paths for all available US states and cities 
resulting in a base set of 42,312 sites (the base set). We loaded each constructed URL with 
Selenium and scraped the site metadata from BuiltWith, including sites’ Traffic categories (“Very 
High,” “High,” “Medium,” “–”).
1. Base URLs:
GPC: https://trends.builtwith.com/ websitelist/Global-Privacy-Control
USPS: https://trends.builtwith.com/ websitelist/US-Privacy-User-Signal-Mechanism
Ad Network: https://trends.builtwith.com/ads/
<ad_network_name>
2. Paths:
(a) /United-States
(b) /United-States/<state>/ for each US state
or USPS-related code. As such, it cannot be used to determine whether a site has a functional GPC 
or USPS implementation.
(c) /United-States/<state>/<city> for each city listed on a /United-States/<state>/ path

To select sites that are more likely to be a business due to having at least 100,000 annual 
California visitors (§3.2.2) and, thus, being subject to the CCPA, we filtered the base set to only 
include sites that had a value of at least “Medium” in BuiltWith’s Traffic category and then 
selected the top 11,708 sites based on BuiltWith’s reported rank of a site on the Tranco list [64]. 
These 11,708 sites form our crawl set. We selected this number of sites because we estimated that 
sites with less traffic and lower Tranco rank would not meet the threshold of 100,000 California 
residents to qualify as a business. To eval-uate whether a site meets the threshold, we used web 
traffic statistics from Similarweb [72], a web analytics service. We correlate the web traffic with 
the Tranco rank as we consider the Tranco list to be the canonical web ranking.⁴

3.2 CCPA Opt Out Right Applicability
For CCPA opt out right applicability (RQ1) a site must (1) sell or share personal information 
(§3.2.1) and (2) be part of a business (§3.2.2).

3.2.1 Selling or Sharing Personal Information
A site “sells” or “shares” personal information per the CCPA if at least one integrated third party 
buys or collects such from the site. To make this determination we leverage Firefox’s Disconnect 
list integration [19, 54], which identifies trackers, classifies them into different categories, 
and exposes the clas-sification result via an API in Firefox’s urlClassification object [49]. We 
want to identify those categories in the Dis-connect list that have the highest chance of 
containing services that collect or buy personal information. To construct a set of services with 
this property we performed a manual analysis of the privacy policies of 115/1,315 (9%) unique 
services in the Advertising, Analytics, Fingerprinting General, Finger-printing Invasive, and 
Social categories of the Disconnect list. We determined for each policy whether it allows a service 
to buy or collect personal information (or sell or share such downstream).⁵ We estimated that a 
number of around 100 analyzed policies would allow us to sufficiently calculate the statistical 
significance of a site in our crawl set buying or collecting personal information.
4Note that while we could not find BuiltWith’s Traffic category definitions, we got an estimate via 
the sites’ Tranco ranks. Appendix A.2, Figure 15 shows the ranges of Tranco ranks of sites included 
in each of BuiltWith’s Traffic categories for the base set. After excluding the “–” Traffic 
category, which presumably means that a site has no or only nominal traffic, and sorting by Tranco 
rank, all sites in our crawl set had a Tranco rank of 163,503 or higher. 5Our analysis is based on 
the Disconnect list of September 15, 2023.
While summing the services of each of the aforementioned categories yields 1,506 total services, 
some of these services are included in multiple categories. Excluding duplicates, there are 1,315 
services.

Disconnect Category     Total
# of Services Analyzed
% that Buy or Collect

Social (S)            19     10     100%
Advertising (A)        1,083     68     93%
Fingerprinting General (FG)   44     13     100%
Analytics            243     15     53%
Fingerprinting Invasive      123     9      78%
S ∪ A ∪ FG (SAFG)      1,097     97     95%

Table 1: Privacy policy analysis results for 115 services on the Disconnect list. For individual 
categories, Total Services is the number of services on the Disconnect list for that category. For 
the SAFG services, Total Services is the number of unique services in the union of categories. Note 
that the number of SAFG services is not equal to the sum of individual services in the Social, 
Advertising, and Fingerprinting General categories as the SAFG union includes cross-listed 
services.

Initially, we randomly selected and analyzed policies of 70/1,083 (6%) Advertising, 15/243 (6%) 
Analytics, 9/44 (20%) Fingerprinting General, 9/123 (7%) Fingerprinting In-vasive, and 9/19 (47%) 
Social services. We omitted 2 Adver-tising services that did not have a privacy policy, resulting 
in 68/1,083 (6%). We also decided to omit the Analytics and Fingerprinting Invasive categories as 
they self-declared CCPA applicability in their privacy policies at a lower rate. We took the union 
of the remaining categories — Social, Advertis-ing, and Fingerprinting General (the SAFG 
categories). To increase our sample size in the SAFG categories, we analyzed policies of 4 
additional randomly selected services in Finger-printing General for 13/44 (30%) and 1 additional 
randomly selected service in Social for 10/19 (53%). We also included policies of 6 services that 
we had originally analyzed as part of the Analytics or Fingerprinting Invasive categories but were 
cross-listed in the Advertising category, resulting in a total of 97 SAFG services. As shown in 
Table 1, 95% of policies we analyzed in the SAFG union declare to buy or collect personal 
information, that is, sites on which they are integrated sell or share personal information. 
Calculating a confidence interval for proportion using z-scores, with 95% confidence the true 
proportion of SAFG services buying or collecting personal information is 91-99%. This interval is a 
lower bound since the determination is based on self-identification in services’ privacy policies.

3.2.2 Business
To evaluate whether a website is part of a business we used web traffic statistics from Similarweb 
[72]. We want to esti-mate which sites in our crawl set have at least 100,000 annual California 
visitors, which would qualify the site as part of a business per the CCPA. Similarweb provides a 
site’s monthly traffic and percentage of traffic by country available for three-month periods. We 
estimate the annual California visitors of a site based on the following equation:













Figure 1: The annual California traffic for every 25th site in our crawl set (n = 468) estimated 
per Equation 1. As the trend was the same when we only included half of the data, i.e., every 50th 
site, we believe the inclusion of every 25th site to be sufficient.



12 ∗ Average Monthly Traffic ∗ CA Population   (1)
US Population
where 12 ∗ Average Monthly Traffic is an upper bound for annual unique visitors as some will be 
repeat visitors.⁶ We ap-plied this equation to manually collected Similarweb October–December 2023 
data, from which we calculated the Average Monthly Traffic, for every 25th site in our crawl set, 
as or-dered by the Tranco list. As indicated in Figure 1, most sites below a Tranco Rank of 28K 
would be considered part of a business under the CCPA based on their web traffic. We cannot draw 
conclusions about the sites that have fewer than 100,000 annual California visitors, as they may 
satisfy a differ-ent threshold of the CCPA’s business definition. For instance, more than half of 
their revenue could come from selling per-sonal information, which is not an unreasonable 
assumption given that data for content is the prevalent business model on the web.⁷
We correlated ranges of Tranco ranks with the probability that a site has at least 100,000 
California visitors. As shown in Figure 2, a lower Tranco rank means that a site is more likely to 
have California traffic that exceeds 100,000 annual visitors. With 95% confidence, a site in the 
first 1,500 sites of our
6While it would be ideal to have a lower bound, we did not find available statistics or a way to 
calculate such. Also, while the number of visitors of a site from California will not be 
proportional to the CA Population for every site, on average, we believe this estimate to be 
reasonable.
7Generally, operationalizing the thresholds of the CCPA business defini-tion from the perspective 
of an outside observer is challenging. The “trans-lation” of the law into technological criteria 
can thwart its effectiveness. This challenge extends beyond the CCPA and applies to other US state 
laws with similar definitions as well. It is rooted in the limits of geographical jurisdictions and 
the attempt of not overburdening small businesses.

an SAFG request between index 1, 500 ∗ 1 − 1, 500 = 0 and
min(1, 500 ∗ 1 − 1, 11, 708) = 1, 499, i.e., 0 to 1, 499. In our
December 2023 crawl data, x₁ = 1,261. Therefore, we arrive at x₁ ∗min(0.967 + 0.045, 1) = 1, 261 ∗ 
1 = 1,261 as an upper bound for number of sites subject to the CCPA in the first 1,500 sites of our 
crawl set. To determine the lower bound, we subtract the error and take the maximum with 0. 
Con-tinuing our n = 1 example in December 2023, we arrive at x₁ ∗max(0.967 −0.045, 0) = 1, 261 ∗ 
0.922 = 1,163 of the first 1,500 sites in our crawl set are subject to the CCPA.⁸






Figure 2: The 95% confidence intervals for ranges of sites having at least 100,000 annual 
California Visitors. Each range contains 60 Similarweb data points and represents 1,500 crawl set 
sites (1,500/25 = 60), except the rightmost, which contains 48 Similarweb data points representing 
1,208 crawl set sites.


crawl set (Tranco rank 0–3K) has a 96.7 ± 4.5% probability of being part of a business per the CCPA 
based on its web traffic. However, a site in the set of the last 1,208 sites of our crawl set 
(Tranco rank 109K–163K) has only a 2.1 ± 4.1% probability. Taken together, the leftmost four boxes 
in Figure 2 indicate that there is about an 89% probability that a site in the first 6K sites of 
our crawl set is part of a business per the CCPA based on web traffic.

3.2.3 Selling or Sharing & Business
Combining the eight confidence intervals shown in Figure 2 with the identified SAFG requests from 
§3.2.1, we can esti-mate the number of sites in our crawl set that are subject to the CCPA. To 
determine the upper bound of sites subject to the CCPA based on web traffic, we use the following 
equation:

min(0.967 + 0.045, 1)
min(0.917 + 0.07, 1)
min(0.883 + 0.081, 1)
3.3 Detecting Privacy String Value Changes
Given the probability of a site being subject to the CCPA opt out right (§3.2), we can run our GPC 
compliance implemen-tation (RQ2) as follows:
1. Check whether the site sells or shares personal information via Firefox’s urlClassification 
object (§3.2.1).
2. Check the values of the US Privacy String, OneTrust’s OptanonConsent cookie, and GPP String, if 
any.
3. Send a GPC signal to the site.
4. Recheck the values per step 2.

In order for a site to be GPC-compliant, the following must be true after the GPC signal was sent 
for each mentioned privacy string that the site implements:
1. The third character of the US Privacy String is a Y.
2. The value of the OptanonConsent cookie contains isGpcEnabled=1.
3. The opt out columns in the GPP String’s relevant US sections (i.e., SaleOptOut and 
SharingOptOut) have a value of 1. In California, the relevant sections are uscav1 or usnatv1, and 
the relevant opt out columns are SaleOptOut and SharingOptOut.
Appendix  A.1  contains  further background infor-mation  on  the  mentioned privacy  strings.  For 
the
.well-known/gpc.json, if any, we detect its gpc value.

To perform the 4-step analysis outlined in §3.3 we imple-mented a Selenium web crawler and Firefox 
browser exten-sion, which is based on OptMeowt’s analysis mode [65]. We crawled our crawl set of 
11,708 sites three times: in Decem-ber 2023, February 2024, and April 2024. All crawls were run on 
a 2018 MacBook Pro with an Intel I7 processor and

where xn is the number of sites with an SAFG request be-tween index 1, 500n− 1, 500 and min(1, 
500n− 1, 11, 708) in our crawl set. We illustrate the CCPA opt out right applica-bility (RQ1) using 
n = 1 in December 2023 as an example: since n = 1, we need to know x₁, the number of sites with
16 GB RAM set to a Los Angeles IP address using Mullvad VPN [56]. Figure 3 shows an overview of our 
setup.
8These bounds do not apply to other thresholds of the CCPA business definition, such as the 
percentage of revenue from selling or sharing personal information.















Figure 3: The high-level architecture of our setup, which includes a Selenium web crawler, SQL 
database, and our OptMeowt analysis extension, all run locally.


3.4.1 Browser Extension
Our extension begins the analysis of a site 7 seconds after DOM content has been loaded. Requests 
to SAFG category sites are identified via Firefox’s urlClassification ob-ject [49] and stored in a 
SQL database for later analysis. Our extension uses the cookies API [48] to check for US Privacy 
and OptanonConsent cookies and injects scripts to call the USPAPI and GPP’s Consent Management 
Platform API (CM-PAPI). We allotted a 2.5-second timeout for the collection of any privacy string 
values. Then, the extension sends a GPC signal, reloads the site, collects the USPS, GPP String, 
and OptanonConsent cookie values again, and stores the results in the database. After a 3-second 
timeout the crawler loads the next site for our extension to analyze. We selected all timeouts to 
minimize idle time while ensuring accurate data collection. The timeouts are based on preliminary 
experiments, particu-larly, ensuring that all site resources are fully loaded.

3.4.2 Selenium Web Crawler
We implemented our crawler using Selenium WebDriver for Firefox Nightly [73]. The crawler’s primary 
purpose is to automate the loading of sites for analysis by the extension. We ran each crawl in 
eight batches of around 1,500 sites. Larger batch sizes lead to more Selenium crashes. After 
finishing all eight batches, we identified each site that had a Selenium error and a subdomain, 
removed the subdomain from the site’s URL, and recrawled all such sites since an invalid subdomain 
was one of the main error sources we encountered.⁹ Our crawler uses non-headless mode to appear 
more similar to a human user. Each site is allotted 35 seconds to load and 22 seconds to be 
analyzed. We found that a 35-second loading period gives slow-loading sites sufficient time to 
load. The
9See Appendix A.4 for details on the errors we encountered.
22-second analysis period is the sum of the timeouts in the analysis extension (§3.4.1).
The crawler logs and attempts to catch any errors that occur while a site loads. Generally, errors 
happen because a site failed to load in 35 seconds, had an insecure certificate, or led to an error 
page. Before moving to the next site, the crawler checks if analysis data for the current site was 
added to the database. If that is not case and there is no Selenium error, a second attempt at 
loading the site may be successful. Thus, the crawler loads the site one more time. This strategy 
greatly improved the success rate for sites that failed to load in 35 seconds on the first attempt. 
Over all crawls, nearly 40% of sites that failed to load on the first attempt were loaded and 
successfully analyzed on the second attempt. In each of our three crawls, about 2% of sites failed 
to load on both attempts. Considering all errors, about 7–9% of sites could not be analyzed in each 
crawl (§4).
Another purpose of the crawler is to identify sites with hu-man checks loading an intermediate page 
that either indicates that access to a site has been denied or prompts users to per-form some 
challenge to prove that they are human. Since the text at the /html/head/title XPath on a site is 
often indica-tive of the presence of a human check, we use a list of regular expressions to match 
this text and determine whether the site has a human check. We rely on this approach as opposed to 
a more complex approach because many sites use a service such as Cloudflare [13] to identify bot 
visitors and, therefore, have the same intermediate page, which is identifiable by regular 
expressions.
Finally, the crawler automates identification of sites that redirect to another domain. If the 
crawler loads a URL that redirects to another domain, the analysis extension logs the analysis data 
in our database under the new domain. There were 644 sites in our crawl set that redirected to a 
different domain in at least one of our three crawls.

3.4.3 .well-known/gpc.json
To determine which sites have a .well-known/gpc.json we use the Python requests library resource 
[68]. This crawl is performed separately and is not part of our Selenium web crawler.

3.5 Accuracy of Non-Compliance Detection
We tested the accuracy of our extension using a 100-site test set (the test set). After our first 
crawl, we randomly selected 60 test set sites from the second batch, which we had randomly selected 
as well. To ensure that there were sufficient sites with GPP Strings in the test set we randomly 
selected 40 sites from the 109 sites for which our first crawl had detected a GPP String. In our 
test procedure we simultaneously compared analysis values, generated by our extension, and ground 
truth values, manually observed by us. As our crawler analyzes data














Figure 4: Privacy strings (left) and GPP String sections (right) found on the sites in the test set 
after a GPC signal was sent.


on the same site load as we observe ground truth values, we can be sure that differences are not 
due to varying site loads. We declared a USPS present if the USPAPI returned a non-null USPS value 
or a usprivacy or similarly named cookie was found. We declared a GPP String present if the GPP 
CMPAPI returned a non-null GPP String value. We declared an OptanonConsent cookie present if we 
found a cookie of that name. If it did not have an isGpcEnabled field, we gave it a value of 
no_gpc. We performed our tests with Mullvad VPN connected to a Los Angeles IP address.
Our extension correctly identified the presence and value of all privacy strings in the test set 
(Figure 4). When identifying the presence and value of GPP Strings, our extension had an accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1 score of 1. Of the 45/100 (45%) test set sites with a GPP String, 36/45 
(80%) had a relevant California section (usnatv1 or uscav1). 3/36 (8%) sites changed the SaleOptOut 
and SharingOptOut fields to opt out after receiving a GPC signal, both of which were correctly 
identified by our extension. It is noticeable that the number of sites changing their values to opt 
out after receiving a GPC signal is generally lower compared to sites already having an opt out 
value set before receiving a GPC signal.¹⁰
In total, a USPS was implemented on 54/100 (54%) sites. With an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 
score of 1, our ex-tension reliably identified the existence and value of the USPS. Our extension 
also correctly identified all 25/54 (46%) sites that changed the third character of the USPS to a 
Yafter receiv-ing a GPC signal, i.e., opted us out. 26/54 (48%) test set sites implemented a USPS 
using the USPAPI only, and the other

10One site only had a GPP String after we sent the GPC signal, which appears to be a result of 
AdRoll’s GPP implementation. The GPP CMPAPI responded both before and after we sent the signal. 
First, it returned an undefined GPP String. Then, it returned an empty GPP String. We found the 
AdRoll script that implemented GPP to respond in this way by searching for _set_global("  gpp" in 
the Firefox Debugger. There were 85 sites in our crawl set that had this behavior in at least one 
of our crawls. We did not manually verify that each of these sites used AdRoll’s GPP 
implementation. As of January 2025 it appears that the AdRoll script has been modified.

Table 2: Our extension’s performance of finding privacy strings in the test set (n = 100). OAC 
Found indicates that an OptanonConsent cookie with an isGpcEnabled value was found. Sale and 
Sharing refer to the SaleOptOut and SharingOptOut fields, respectively, in the usnatv1 or uscav1 
sections of the GPP String. (USPS = US Privacy String, OAC = OptanonConsent cookie, TP = True 
Positives, FP = False Positives, TN = True Negatives, FN = False Nega-tives, # = Total, P = 
Precision, R = Recall, F1 = F1 score.)

28/54 (52%) used both the USPAPI and cookies highlighting the importance of correctly identifying a 
USPS via the US-PAPI. Our extension also had an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 1 when 
identifying the presence and value of OptanonConsent cookies. An OptanonConsent cookie with an 
isGpcEnabled field was found on 32/100 (32%) sites, 21/32 (66%) of which opted us out after 
receiving a GPC signal. Our extension also correctly identified the 1 site that had an 
OptanonConsent cookie without an isGpcEnabled field. Table 2 shows our complete results.

3.6 Limitations
Our approach is subject to various limitations. First, we de-termine CCPA applicability based on an 
estimate of a site’s California web traffic. For our estimate we only analyzed web traffic data for 
1/25th of our crawl set. We also do not consider other CCPA applicability thresholds, e.g., the 
annual revenues from selling or sharing personal information, which, however, could only lead to an 
increase of sites subject to the CCPA. For determining whether a site is selling or sharing 
personal information we rely on the classification of an integrated third party as buying or 
collecting such as described in its privacy policy, which is subject to legal interpretation, may 
not re-flect their actual practice, and can change over time. We also assume that Firefox’s 
webRequest API always returns the correct urlClassification for a site. Also, our extension cannot 
analyze sites that block script injection as we use such to call the USPAPI and GPP CMPAPI. 
Previous work found that up to 14% of websites detect automated browsers [43]. We identified that 
1.6–2.6% of sites in our crawl set had a

human check. While we used a California VPN, some sites may have detected that we are not actually 
in California, treat-ing us differently. However, if sites were detecting our true location, we 
would expect to see the section of the GPP String of the state in which we are truly located, which 
we did not see using a VPN but did see without it. Our crawl set as a whole is certainly not 
comprehensive and may also not be representative for the overall GPC compliance on the web or in 
regard to our other findings as we constructed it from BuiltWith and relied on its pre-selection of 
sites.

4 Results
Our crawler successfully analyzed 10,690/11,708 (91%) sites in December 2023, 10,815/11,708 (92%) 
sites in February 2024, and 10,902/11,708 (93%) sites in April 2024. The re-maining sites’ analyses 
failed due to errors.¹¹ The success rate of our crawler is similar to the performance reported in 
previous work [78]. The average analysis time per site was
30.7 seconds in December 2023, 30.5 seconds in February 2024, and 30.4 seconds in April 2024. We 
now evaluate the applicability of the CCPA opt out right to the sites in our crawl set (§4.1), 
determine their opt out rates (§4.2), evaluate inconsistencies in sites’ opt out behavior due to 
the imple-mentation of multiple privacy strings (§4.3), and illustrate the impact big publishers’ 
privacy string configurations can have on opt out rates (§4.4).

4.1 CCPA Opt Out Right Applicability
About 90% of sites in our crawl set integrated at least one SAFG category service in all three 
crawls.

4.1.1 How Many Sites Sell or Share?
As shown in Figure 5, we further divided this subset of sites into Verified and Likely Integration 
categories based on whether a site integrated a service we manually verified (§3.2.1). For Verified 
Integration sites, which account for
11See Appendix A.4 for details on the errors we encountered.
Figure 6: SAFG services integrated in the crawl set sites and their privacy strings.


about 87% of sites in all three crawls, we are certain that they sell or share. For Likely 
Integration sites, which account for about 250 sites, we have 95% confidence that 91–99% sell or 
share (§3.2.1). The remaining 10% of sites, shown in the No Integration category, do not integrate 
any SAFG service.¹² Figure 6 shows that sites in the Verified Integration category are most likely 
to have a privacy string, i.e., at least one of USPS, GPP String, OptanonConsent cookie, or 
.wellknown/gpc.json. More specifically, 3,186/9,352 (34%) of Verified Integration sites, 40/226 
(18%) of Likely Integration sites, and 142/1,112 (13%) of No Integration sites had a privacy string 
in December 2023. In February 2024, 3,368/9,469 (36%) of Verified Integration sites, 34/220 (15%) 
of Likely Integration sites, and 148/1,126 (13%) of No Inte-gration sites had a privacy string. 
These percentages increased to 3,499/9,502 (37%), 67/258 (26%), and 165/1,142 (14%) in
April 2024, respectively.

4.1.2 Which Sites Are Subject to the CCPA Opt Out?
Given that nearly 90% of the sites we successfully crawled in December 2023 have evidence of 
selling or sharing per-sonal information, we determine if these sites are part of a business per 
the CCPA. We use Equation 2 to calculate the upper bound and the analogous equation to calculate 
the lower bound. Based on this calculation we estimate that 4,465–5,929 of the 9,578 sites, 47–62% 
according to the 95% confidence interval, that had a request from an SAFG service in Decem-ber 2023 
also meet the traffic requirement per §3.2.2 and, thus, are subject to the CCPA opt out right.¹³
Overall, as Figure 7 illustrates, sites higher ranked in the Tranco list are more likely to be 
subject to the CCPA as they
12It could also be that a site in this category had an uncaught error that did not crash our 
crawler and, thus, went unnoticed. The same consideration applies to sites in the No Integration, 
No Privacy String category in Figure 6 and the No Ad Network category in Figure 7.
13In addition, just the inclusion of a privacy string, as such, given that it relates to 
California, indicates that a site is subject to the CCPA.













Figure 7: The distribution of privacy strings over our crawl set in December 2023. The trend is 
similar for the two subsequent crawls. Each bar represents 1,500 sites, except the rightmost, which 
represents 1,208 sites. The remaining percentage of sites were sites that could not be analyzed due 
to errors. No Ad Network means that the site did not integrate any SAFG category service, which 
includes both Likely and Verified Integration SAFG categories. (PS = Privacy String.)












Figure 8: The distribution of sites’ privacy string imple-mentations in December 2023 (n = 3, 074), 
February 2024
(n = 3, 246), and April 2024 (n = 3, 402), from left to right. We define a privacy string to be 
implemented if it ever has a non-null value (i.e., before GPC, after GPC, or both).


include a privacy string and are also more likely to sell or share as they more often include an 
SAFG service. Smaller sites seem to monetize their content to a lesser degree. While Figure 2 
suggests a sharp drop in CCPA applicability and, thus, implemented privacy strings after a Tranco 
rank of about 28K, we observe a steadier decrease here. It could be that sites ranked lower on the 
Tranco list may still be subject to the CCPA opt out right due to their revenues. These trends stay 
consistent for February and April 2024.

4.2  Privacy String Adoption and Opt Outs
For evaluating sites’ privacy string adoption and resulting opt out behavior we only consider sites 
with evidence of selling or sharing as these could be subject to the CCPA. Specifically,


Figure 9: OptanonConsent cookie opt outs. The total counts, n, refer to the total number of sites 
that implemented an Op-tanonConsent cookie per our definition of an implemented privacy string 
(Figure 8). Some sites had a non-null privacy string value either only before or only after sending 
a GPC signal. Thus, the values on the bars do not all sum to n. All counts were slightly lower 
before sending a GPC signal.


we only consider sites in the Likely and Verified Integration categories (Figure 5). From Figure 6, 
we see that the percent-age of sites with evidence of selling or sharing and imple-mentation of at 
least one privacy string increased slowly from 34% (3,226/9,578) in December 2023 to 35% 
(3,402/9,689)
in February 2024 and 37% (3,566/9,760) in April 2024. GPP String implementations significantly 
increased between De-cember 2023 and February 2024 from 7% (677/9,578) to 12% (1,113/9,689). This 
time period coincided with the IAB’s deprecation of the USPS. Between February and April 2024 GPP 
String implementation continued at a slower rate. De-spite its deprecation, the percentage of sites 
with a USPS remained largely the same between December 2023 and April 2024. Overall, for our GPC 
compliance evaluation (RQ3) we find that in December 2023, 44% (1,411/3,226) of sites opted out via 
all privacy strings they implemented (i.e., one or more of the USPS, GPP String, OptanonConsent 
cookie, and
.wellknown/gpc.json). In February 2024, this percentage decreased to 43% (1,473/3,402) before 
increasing to 45% (1,620/3,566) in April 2024. The percentage of sites that im-plemented at least 
one privacy string and opted out via none was 46% (1,477/3,226) in December 2023, 45% (1,519/3,402)
in February 2024, and 45% (1,598/3,566) in April 2024.

4.2.1 OptanonConsent Cookie Adoption and Opt Outs
The percentage of sites opting out via the OptanonConsent cookie increased slightly each crawl 
(Figure 9). Compared to the other privacy strings, it has the highest percentages of being in an 
opted out state after a GPC signal; 66% (1,035/1,560), 67% (1,061/1,594), and 68% (1,142/1,687) of












Figure 10: Cumulative counts of GPP String sections. For example, if we observed a [usnatv1,uspv1] 
string, i.e., sections for the deprecated USPS and US national laws, as described in Appendix 
A.1.2, such string adds one count to usnvatv1 and one count to uspv1. The tcfeuv2 and tcfcav1 GPP 
sections are the EU and Canadian sections, respectively.















Figure 11: USPS opt outs. Some sites had a non-null privacy string value either only before or only 
after sending a GPC signal. Also, 3 (December 2023), 2 (February 2024), and 3 (April 2024) sites 
had an invalid USPS value (e.g., 1---N).


OptanonConsent cookies opted out in December 2023, Febru-ary 2024, and April 2024, respectively. 
One site, in April 2024, was in an opted out state before we sent a GPC signal. Some sites had an 
OptanonConsent cookie without isGpcEnabled field, shown as Not Applicable in Figure 9. Across 
crawls about 10% of sites fell into this category. A few sites removed the isGpcEnabled field after 
receiving a GPC signal causing the Not Applicable category to increase after GPC.

4.2.2 USPS Adoption and Opt Outs
Despite its deprecation at the end of January 2024, the USPS remained the most prevalent privacy 
string in our crawl set (Figure 11). The percentage of sites that implemented a USPS remained 
relatively constant each crawl indicating the slow pace of change in the industry. The percentage 
of sites that opt out via USPS after a GPC signal increased from 39% (663/1,687) in December 2023 
to 46% (777/1,698) in Febru-ary 2024 before decreasing to 44% (770/1,740) in April 2024.
4.2.3 GPP Adoption and Opt Outs
We observed a substantial increase in GPP String implemen-tations reflecting the IAB’s transition 
from USPS to GPP (RQ4). In December 2023, uspv1, the deprecated USPS sec-tion within the GPP 
String, was the most common section, followed by usnatv1 (Figure 10). While the number of sites 
with a usnatv1 or uspv1 section increased slightly in Febru-ary 2024, the frequency of the uscav1 
section, which is re-placing the deprecated USPS, nearly tripled and became the most common 
section. Most of the new instances came from sites that did not have a GPP String in December 2023 
and im-plemented a GPP String that only includes the uscav1 section in February 2024. It appears 
these sites use Google Funding Choices to implement GPP indicating the impact a single service can 
have.¹⁴ In April 2024, the uspv1 section became the most common section, followed by uscav1. 
Interestingly, in all three crawls, the uspv1 section rarely occurred alone in a GPP String but 
usually paired with at least one other section indicating a period of transition and spillover 
effects.
Considering only sites with a GPP String in each crawl, the rate of GPP adoption between December 
2023 and February 2024 was 218 sites per month and decreased to 72 sites per month between February 
and April 2024. Even if the initial rate of 218 sites per month resumes, it would take about four 
years for the remaining sites in our crawl set to implement a GPP String, and only about 72% of 
sites would have a section relevant to California. In fact, most sites do not make use of the GPC 
option that is already available to them. The
14Funding Choices was Google’s CMP created in 2017 with the intent of helping publishers recover ad 
revenue lost to ad blockers [12]. In 2020, Fund-ing Choices added functionality to allow publishers 
to communicate with site visitors regarding CCPA and GDPR consent [41]. While Funding Choices has 
since been integrated into other Google advertising platforms [24], the ana-lyzed sites have a 
file, m=kernel_loader,loader_js_executable, which serves as the GPP CMPAPI for those sites and also 
references Funding Choices objects. This implementation may not explain the increase for all sites. 
However, we manually spot-checked and inspected this file for 20 sites. These results are from the 
time of our crawls and may have changed since.

Figure 12: The value of the GPC subsection found in the usnatv1 or uscav1 sections before and after

value of 0 indicates that the site has not.















Figure 13: Opt outs via the SaleOptOut field in the usnatv1 and uscav1 sections of the GPP String. 
For opting out via the SharingOptOut field see Appendix A.6, Figure 16.


usnatv1 and uscav1 sections include a GPC subsection that stores whether the site has received a 
GPC signal.¹⁵ Per the IAB, sites “should” check for a GPC signal and store its value in this 
subsection [35]. However, only 18% (82/468), 26% (206/803), and 29% (258/899) of sites did so in 
December 2023, February 2024, and April 2024, respectively (Figure 12). Thus, a large percentage of 
sites are either not looking for a GPC signal or omit logging it in this subsection.
For evaluating GPP opt outs in California, where GPC com-pliance is required and enforced [75], we 
consider sites with a uscav1 or usnatv1 GPP section. GPC selling opt out rates via the GPP String 
are low (Figure 13). In December 2023, after a GPC signal was sent, 9% (44/468) of sites opted the 
user out of selling. These rates increased to 13% (106/803) in February 2024 and 15% (131/899) in 
April 2024. These rates remain much lower than those of the OptanonConsent cookie

recognize GPC as a valid opt out mechanism.
(§4.2.1) and the USPS (§4.2.2). One reason could be that the OptanonConsent cookie and USPS are 
easy to understand; OneTrust handles the implementation of the OptanonConsent cookie and the USPS 
is only four characters. There is evi-dence that implementing a GPP String is challenging as it 
requires understanding how to encode, decode, and construct various sections of the string [67]. 
The IAB extended the deprecation date of the USPS twice to give publishers more time to implement 
GPP (Appendix A.1.2). Thus, lower opt out rates may be, partly, due to the complexity of GPP. The 
online ad ecosystem’s general slow pace may also play a role.

4.2.4 .well-known/gpc.json Adoption
We ran three crawls to examine .well-known/gpc.json adoption. The optional .well-known/gpc.json 
allows sites to declare to the world that they are respecting GPC by posting a public JSON file 
[85]. However, as shown in Table 3, fewer than 200 sites made use of this option in each crawl. 3 
(Jan 2024), 2 (Feb 2024), and 2 (April 2024) sites in the .well-known/gpc.json only category of 
Ta-ble 3 set the value of gpc to False. The remaining sites set it to True. There is not much 
overlap of sites with a
.well-known/gpc.json and other privacy strings. This find-ing could mean that a number of sites use 
custom implemen-tations for GPC compliance as they do not implement the USPS, GPP String, or 
OptanonConsent cookie but still claim compliance via the .well-known/gpc.json. However, sites could 
also implement another privacy string we do not cover here. It may also be the case that compliance 
rates are actually higher than we found via privacy strings. Generally, this un-certainty shows the 
difficulty of determining GPC compliance from the outside, especially, for custom implementations.

4.3 Inconsistent Privacy String Opt Outs
Because of the lack of overlap between other privacy strings and .well-known/gpc.json, we set aside 
implementations of the .well-known/gpc.json in this section, considering only implementations of 
the other three privacy strings. A number of sites implemented more than one of these privacy 
strings. We consider a privacy string to be implemented if

their behavior, these differences were primarily caused by big publishers. For example, a group of 
41 Lee Enterprises [44] sites did not opt out in December 2023, opted out in February 2024, and 
then did not opt out again in April 2024. Also, a group of at least 75 Townsquare Media [77] sites 
opted out in

vacy strings implemented either a uscav1 or usnatv1 section in their GPP String. The biggest 
inconsistency was 8 sites in the OAC + USPS Opt Out Only category in December 2023. 7/8 (88%) sites 
were Penske Media Corporation (PMC) [63] sites. Their GPP implementation was corrected for the next 
two crawls. However, there were additional PMC sites that did not opt out via any privacy string in 
December 2023 but opted out via all privacy strings in February and April 2024. This result 
suggests that deployment of privacy string imple-

and Appendix, Table 7.

it has a non-null value. We further consider it to opt out if it satisfies the criteria for opting 
out per §3.3. In December 2023, 11% (325/3,074) of sites had inconsistent opt outs. This percentage 
increased to 12% (400/3,246) in February 2024 before decreasing to 10% (338/3,402) in April 2024.¹⁶

4.3.1 Sites with Exactly Two Privacy Strings
Considering sites with exactly two privacy strings, Table 4 shows that sites with a USPS and GPP 
String predominantly either opt out via USPS only or not at all. For instance, per the first 
column, there were 514 total sites in December 2023 with both a USPS and GPP String. 285 of these 
sites opted out via USPS only after receiving a GPC signal. This lack of GPP opt outs is partially 
due to 30% of sites in this category lacking the relevant California sections, usnatv1 or uscav1, 
and thus, they cannot meet our definition of opting out. For instance, a group of 51 MediaNews 
Group [50] sites opted out via the USPS in all three crawls but did not have the usnatv1 or uscav1 
section in their GPP Strings. The GPP’s fairly recent introduction and its complexity could be 
reasons for the

strings. Appendix A.7, Table 7 contains further details on the opt out counts of crawl set sites 
with exactly one privacy string.
mentations to a group of sites may not be a trivial task as there may be edge cases when automating 
this process. The 4 sites in the OAC + GPP Opt Out Only category in February 2024 had USPS values 
of 1--- indicating that the sites deemed the CCPA not applicable. These sites had the same behavior 
in April 2024. The None Opt Out category includes sites from Nexstar Media Group, Inc. [57], which 
had only a USPS and OptanonConsent cookie in December 2023 and implemented a GPP String sometime 
before February 2024. While they did not opt out via any string in any crawl, they updated the GPP 
GPC subsection after receiving a GPC signal.

4.4  Identifying Big Publishers that Handle GPP Implementation for Multiple Sites
As discussed (§4.3), a substantial number of sites is impacted by GPP String settings that are 
handled by big publishers for multiple sites. Such publishers may have tens, hundreds, or even 
thousands of sites. They may implement the same GPP String on each, possibly, relying on a library 
to set its values. To understand the impact of multi-site rollouts of GPP Strings for opt out 
compliance we set out to identify big publishers that handle GPP implementation.¹⁸
17Our extension failed to analyze most of the Townsquare Media sites in December 2023. Of the 
Townsquare Media sites that were analyzed in December 2023, most did not opt out. Appendix, Table 6 
shows details of the analysis errors we encountered during our crawls. Note that, generally, any 
change in behavior of a site may not be due to a change in implementation but rather a result of 
fluctuation during different site loads.
18Appendix A.5 contains our protocol for this identification task.

When constructing their GPP String, publishers select sec-tions as well as field values within each 
section, which are then encoded to form the GPP String. To determine common choices for 
combinations of sections and field values in GPP Strings, we compared the encoded strings (i.e., 
the string char-acters) and found 46 unique strings in December 2023, 55 unique strings in February 
2024, and 57 unique strings in April 2024. In each crawl, the five most frequent GPP Strings 
accounted for over half of all GPP String instances. We looked at a few different prevalent GPP 
Strings and found that a small number of big publishers has outsize impact.
For instance, there are 188 sites in our crawl set with a GPP String value of “DBABBg∼BUoAAAKA.QA” 
before receiving a GPC signal in February 2024.¹⁹ Most of these sites are published by the USA 
Today Network [80], Nexstar Media Group, Inc. [57], and PMC [63]. Similarly, in Febru-ary 2024, 
Raptive [66] sites all had a GPP String value of “DBABzw∼∼BVQqAAAAAgA” before receiving a GPC 
signal.²⁰ We noticed that when we reloaded a Raptive site twice after sending a GPC signal, the GPP 
String would opt out of sale and sharing.
We informed Raptive staff of this finding. They responded that the code to check for GPC signals 
was built into the wrong JavaScript file and ran too late after the first page load, however, only 
affected the first page load of the first session of a new user. They informed us that after we 
reported the bug they fixed it, and GPC now works correctly on all page loads, including the first. 
Since our extension only loaded a site once before and once after sending a GPC signal, we counted 
all Raptive sites as not opting out in our crawls. There are 192 Raptive sites in our crawl set. 
Given the correction, the April 2024 opt out rates for the selling of personal informa-tion 
increase from 15% (131/899) (§4.2.3) to 36% (323/899) showing the impact of a single privacy string 
implementation of a big publisher on the overall opt out compliance rates.

5 Discussion
Effective enforcement is critical for making the opt out right meaningful on the web and beyond. 
However, bridging the gap between legal requirements and technological implemen-tations requires 
significant effort and technical expertise on part of the regulators, e.g., for determining whether 
a site is subject to the CCPA opt out right (§3.2). Our main recom-mendation for regulators (RQ5) 
is to focus on big publish-ers to alert them of their obligations and fix incorrect GPC opt out 
implementations (§4.3 and §4.4). Many small and medium-sized businesses rely on big publishers for 
their com-pliance implementations. By addressing the source of these
19This GPP String contains the uscav1 section and does not opt out of sale or sharing. The string 
can be decoded at https://iabgpp.com/.

issues, regulators can efficiently drive widespread improve-ments. This strategy can be 
complemented by enforcement actions against high-profile publishers of individual sites to 
broadcast to the industry as a whole to take compliance se-riously. Furthermore, it is important 
that regulators provide education and guidance to businesses and users.
While some businesses may be delaying their GPC imple-mentations deliberately, especially, as a big 
part of the industry is still non-compliant (§4.2), others may simply be unaware of their 
obligations or face technical hurdles. The latter point is illustrated by the many inconsistent 
privacy string implemen-tations we found (§4.3). We think it would be useful if regu-lators reach 
out to the IAB and other industry organizations as well as CMPs requesting that those remind their 
members and customers of their obligations and where they can find guidance. There are already a 
number of useful resources available, e.g., on https://globalprivacycontrol.org/ or published by 
the Office of the Connecticut Attorney Gen-eral [59]. To help in this effort we make our software 
and data publicly available (§8). For example, using our crawler, publishers with multiple sites 
can efficiently evaluate the com-pliance status of their entire portfolio. In addition to educating 
businesses, raising awareness among users and the tools they can use to exercise their rights is 
equally important.
The effectiveness of opt out compliance depends on the further evolution of the online ad ecosystem 
and its integra-tion into the web platform. To evaluate whether a site respects a user’s opt out 
choices we relied on privacy strings. How-ever, it is not guaranteed that every site implements 
those as required. Further, even if that were the case, sites receiving personal information may 
simply disregard the privacy strings they receive. The only way for an outside observer to 
deter-mine compliance in the current nontransparent environment is through experimentation, for 
example, by adding products to shopping carts on retailer sites with GPC enabled and check-ing 
whether those products later show up in ads on other sites. However, such experiments do not solve 
the core problem. To fundamentally improve data transparency and privacy en-forcement effectiveness 
on the web platform a comprehensive reform of the online ad ecosystem is necessary.

6 Conclusions
Our results show that GPC adoption is gradually increas-ing and corresponding to the evolving 
privacy law landscape. Adapting to new privacy laws requires expertise and resources. Especially, 
smaller businesses may not be aware of their obli-gations. Some businesses may also perceive the 
risk of non-compliance to be low. Others may face technical challenges, especially, if they need to 
roll out changes to a large number of sites. Our findings highlight the importance of effective 
enforcement. Ultimately, opt out compliance is reliant on the evolution of the online ad ecosystem 
overall. Big improve-ments require a systems solution.

7 Ethics Considerations
We consider the ethical risks of our study to be low. We only visited each site a few times and did 
not extensively probe or penetrate sites’ security or privacy protections. We only collected 
publicly available data. The data we shared with the sites and third parties was our own and did 
not involve data of any external research participants. We notified each publisher named in our 
study and gave them an opportunity to comment. We only received a substantive reply from Raptive, 
as described. All legal analysis was performed by the last author who is admitted to the California 
bar association (inac-tive status) and has expertise in privacy law. We are currently working with 
three regulators identifying non-compliant sites based on the methodology and results of this 
study. For confi-dentiality reasons we are unable to share further details.

Figure 14: An example USPS indicating (1) version 1 is used,
(2) the site gave the user notice of the CCPA and the opportu-nity to opt out, (3) the user opted 
out of sale, and (4) the site is not operating under the IAB’s Limited Service Provider Agreement. 
Our approach focuses on the third character to detect whether a site respects GPC (§3.3).


A Appendix
A.1 GPC and Privacy String Background
A.1.1 GPC Signals
GPC was developed by a coalition of privacy-minded aca-demics, browser vendors, web publishers, 
CMPs, and non-governmental organizations to help people exercise their opt out rights on the web 
and other platforms [85]. In contrast to site-by-site DNSLs, this binary signal is intended to 
provide a “comprehensive option that broadly signals [a consumer’s] opt-out request” [74]. The OAG 
states that GPC signals “must be honored by covered businesses as a valid consumer request to stop 
the sale or sharing of personal information” and en-forces this requirement [74, 75]. The first 
enforcement of GPC by the OAG happened in August 2022 against Sephora resulting in a settlement in 
which Sephora was ordered to pay a $1.2 million penalty and reform its privacy practices to com-ply 
with the CCPA [75]. GPC is also adopted as a universal opt out mechanism in Colorado [58] and 
Connecticut [59]. To date, 19 US states have passed comprehensive privacy laws [22]. 12 of these 
laws provide for opt out rights to be exercised via universal opt out mechanisms, such as GPC.²¹

A.1.2 Privacy Strings
The USPS and GPP String  In November 2019, the IAB provided the USPS (Figure 14), a four-character 
string that communicates a user’s opt out status and other CCPA require-ments [39]. The third 
character of this string indicates the user’s opt out status; a value of Y means the user was opted 
out, a value of N means the user was not opted out, and a value of “-” means the CCPA does not 
apply.
The USPS can be implemented with either the IAB’s client-side JavaScript USPAPI or an HTTP cookie 
[86]. The IAB released the USPS’s successor, the GPP String, on September 28, 2022 in an effort to 
support additional privacy laws [33]. Sites using the USPS were expected to transition to the GPP
21The states are: CA, CO, CT, NJ, OR, MT, NE, TX, MN, MD, DE, NH.

String by the USPS’s deprecation date. Originally, the depre-cation date was July 1, 2023, but the 
IAB pushed the date back twice, for a final deprecation date of January 31, 2024 [52, 53]. The GPP 
String has sections for privacy laws in Canada, the EU, and multiple US states.
The uscav1 section specifically supports CCPA require-ments and replaces the deprecated USPS. Site 
operators also have the option to simultaneously comply with all US state pri-vacy laws by 
following the US National Approach and imple-menting the usnatv1 section.²² Since we are concerned 
with the opt out right in California, we focus on the SaleOptOut and SharingOptOut fields of the 
uscav1 and usnatv1 sec-tions. For both of these fields, a value of 1 means the user was opted out, 
a value of 2 means the user was not opted out, and a value of 0 means this field is not applicable 
[35].

GPP String Decoding  Because site operators can include multiple regional sections in a GPP String, 
it is possible that GPP Strings can be “too long for certain applications” [34]. To manage string 
length, GPP Strings are encoded using Fi-bonacci encoding [34]. We collected encoded GPP Strings 
during our crawls, as described in §3.3, and decoded them to determine user opt out status. The IAB 
provides a JavaScript library that websites can use to handle encoding and decoding of GPP Strings 
[38]. The IAB also maintains a website with a form that will encode and decode single GPP Strings 
[37]. Since we used Python to perform our data analysis and needed to decode hundreds of GPP 
Strings at once, neither of the IAB’s options suited our needs. Thus, we converted the IAB’s 
JavaScript library to a Python script for decoding GPP Strings during our data analysis.

The OptanonConsent Cookie  Some site operators out-source privacy law compliance to CMPs or similar 
platforms that provide a library to capture people’s privacy preference signals and obtain consent. 
One such CMP is OneTrust [60]. OneTrust’s OptanonConsent cookie is a first-party cookie that 
indicates the consent status of a site visitor. It can be found on sites that integrate the 
OneTrust Banner Content Delivery Network, OneTrust’s cookie consent banner solu-tion [61]. The 
OptanonConsent cookie has an isGpcEnabled field, which has a value of 1 when (1) GPC is enabled, 
mean-ing the site responds to GPC signals, and (2) the site has received a GPC signal from a user’s 
browser. If GPC is not enabled or a GPC signal was not received from the browser, the value of the 
isGpcEnabled field will be 0 [61]. Some OptanonConsent cookies lack this field, which seems to be 
the result of combining OneTrust’s dataLayer object with Google Tag Manager [62].
22The US National Approach is defined in section 1.81 of the IAB’s Multi-State Privacy Agreement 
(MSPA) [32]. Under the US National Approach, sites must treat users generally as if each privacy 
law jurisdiction is applicable to them. In practice, this approach means that the site is complying 
with the most stringent set of opt out requirements.
A.2  Tranco Rank of Sites by BuiltWith Traffic Category















Figure 15: A histogram of Tranco rank ranges for sites in each of the four BuiltWith Traffic 
categories: “Very High,” “High,” “Medium,” and “–.” Sites with a rank of “1,000,000+” were given a 
rank of 1M. The x-axis is on log scale.


A.3 CCPA Definitions
• Selling: “selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminat-ing, making available, 
transferring, or otherwise communi-cating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a 
consumer’s personal information by the business to a third party for monetary or other valuable 
consideration” (CCPA,
§1798.140(ad)(1))
• Sharing: “sharing, renting, releasing, disclosing, dissem-inating, making available, 
transferring, or otherwise com-municating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a 
consumer’s personal information by the business to a third party for cross-context behavioral 
advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable considera-tion, including transactions 
between a business and a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising for the bene-fit of a 
business in which no money is exchanged” (CCPA,
§1798.140(ah)(1))
• Business: “A sole proprietorship, partnership, limited lia-bility company, corporation, 
association, or other legal en-tity that is organized or operated for the profit or financial 
benefit of its shareholders or other owners, that collects con-sumers’ personal information, or on 
the behalf of which such information is collected and that alone, or jointly with others, 
determines the purposes and means of the process-ing of consumers’ personal information, that does 
business in the State of California, and that satisfies one or more of the following thresholds:

2. Qualitatively assess whether these sites could be part of the same organization:
(a) Look at all the site names and try to group them into categories (i.e., news, pop culture, 
blog).
(b) Visit some sites in a category and look for evidence that the site is part of a larger 
organization. Usually, the page footer or privacy policy is indicative of this.

these errors and continue its analysis. Human Check and Timeout errors are described in §3.4.2. A

A.4 Errors Caught During Crawls
Errors in the “Other” category of Table 6 are errors that we could not categorize otherwise. The 
decrease in this category appears to be largely due to the successful analysis of a group of 
Townsquare Media sites in February and April 2024 that failed in December 2023. We are unsure of 
why the analy-sis failed in December 2023. The primary reasons for other unidentified errors were 
that sites blocked script injection or redirected between multiple domains. There was a large 
decrease in human checks in April 2024. We are unsure of the cause. However, some variation in the 
particular sites that have a human check in each crawl is expected. For instance, while there were 
307 sites with a human check in each of our first two crawls, only 270 sites had a human check in 
both
GPP String.
(a) Search in the Firefox Debugger for terms unique to GPP that could relate to setting a GPP 
String. For example, “usnat,” “setgpp,” or “SaleOptOut” could be productive search terms, while 
searching for “gpp” alone usually brings up instances of services looking for GPP String values.
(b) Determine if any of the files found in the previous step actually set the GPP String. If so, 
visit more sites and see if the GPP String is set by the same code on those sites.

A Artifact Appendix
A.1 Abstract
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and its reg-ulations give California residents the right 
to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information. Similar privacy rights exist in 
other jurisdictions as well. These rights can be exercised via Global Privacy Control (GPC) [9]. 
GPC is a binary privacy preference signal that can be implemented in browsers, browser extensions, 
mobile operating systems, and other software. GPC signals are sent via HTTP headers or can be set 
via a JavaScript DOM property. When a first-party site receives a GPC signal, it must propagate 
users’ opt out pref-erences to integrated third parties, such as ad networks. This propagation is 
done using privacy strings, such as the Global Privacy Platform (GPP) String [5]. To evaluate 
websites’ com-pliance with the CCPA opt out right expressed via GPC, we implemented our main 
artifact: a GPC web crawler based on the Selenium WebDriver [8] and a browser extension for 
analyzing privacy string propagation. We based our browser extension on the OptMeowt extension in 
analysis mode [6], as described and implemented by Zimmeck et al. [10]. Our browser extension 
identifies sites’ GPC compliance by send-ing GPC signals to sites and detecting the presence of 
privacy strings, their values, and value changes in response to receiv-ing GPC signals. In addition 
to our GPC web crawler we also provide a Python script for decoding GPP Strings, crawl data, and 
privacy policy analysis results, the latter of which we used to identify selling and sharing of 
personal information from first to third parties.

A.2 Description & Requirements
The artifact requires a consumer-grade computer with Docker [3] and Python [7] (version 3.10 or 
later) installed.

A.2.1 Security, privacy, and ethical concerns
None.
A.2.2 How to access
All artifacts are available in our Zenodo repository [4].

A.2.3 Hardware dependencies
While there are no particular hardware dependencies, we tested the functionality described here 
using a MacBook with macOS operating system.

A.2.4 Software dependencies
We use Docker [3] for the GPC web crawler and Python [7] for the GPP privacy string decoding.

A.2.5 Benchmarks
None

A.3 Set-up
1. Create a Docker account [2].
2. Authenticate to Docker Hub [1].
3. Install Python [7].

A.3.1 Installation
• Download and unzip gpc-web-crawler.zip from the Zen-odo repository.
• Download and unzip cmp_api_python.zip from the Zen-odo repository.

A.3.2 Basic Test
GPC Web Crawler Test
1. Open a new terminal session.
2. Navigate to the gpc-web-crawler-main directory. This directory was created by unzipping 
gpc-web-crawler.zip.

3. From within that directory run make custom.
4. Once completed, the results from the crawl are saved to the ./crawl_results directory. The 
directory the results are saved to is prefixed with "CUSTOMCRAWL" and suffixed with the timestamp 
you started the crawl with. Verify that there is an entry for yelp.com in each of the analysis.json 
and well-known-data.csv files.

Python Installation Check
1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command:

python3 --version


3. If the command returns a version earlier than 3.10 or indicates Python is not installed, 
download and install Python 3.10 or later from the official website: https:
//www.python.org/downloads/.

A.4 Evaluation workflow
A.4.1 Major Claims
(C1): We identify sites’ compliance with the CCPA opt out right when receiving GPC signals at scale 
and over time.

A.4.2 Experiments
(E1): [~10 compute-minutes]: The main experiment is run-ning the GPC web crawler on a batch of 
sites. The result of the experiment is a dataset of 10 sites’ privacy string behavior when 
receiving GPC signals.
Preparation: It is assumed that you have followed the set-up instructions (§A.3).
Execution: Run the experiment as follows:
1. Open a new terminal session.
2. Navigate to the gpc-web-crawler-main direc-tory that you created when unzipping 
gpc-web-crawler.zip.
3. Ensure no Docker containers are running by execut-ing the command make stop.
4. Run make start.
5. When prompted to select a batch (0-8), select 0.
6. Once completed, the result are saved to the
./crawl_results directory. The directory the results are saved to is prefixed with "CRAWLSET0" and 
suffixed with the timestamp you started the crawl with.
Results: Verify the contents of CRAWLSET0. analy-sis.json and well-known-data.csv should contain 
the pri-vacy string analysis results for 10 sites. An error-logging subdirectory will also be 
created, recording extra data collected during crawl failures. In that subdirectory, there will be 
a file named error-logging.json, a JSON file as-sociating domains with the exception that caused 
the crawler to fail. If possible, a screenshot of the site will also be taken and saved in this 
subdirectory.
(E2): [~5 developer minutes]: The second experiment con-sists of decoding GPP Strings.
Preparation: It is assumed that you have followed the set-up instructions (§A.3).
Execution: Run the experiment as follows:
1. Open a new terminal session.
2. Extract the file cmp_api_python.zip.
3. Navigate into the resulting cmp_api_python direc-tory:
cd cmp_api_python

4. Run the decoding script with Python:
python3 decode.py

5. When  prompted, enter  the  GPP  string
DBABBg~BUUAAAGA.YA.
Results: Verify the output matches the following object:
{"uscav1": {
"Version": 1,
"SaleOptOutNotice": 1,
"SharingOptOutNotice": 1,
"SensitiveDataLimitUseNotice": 0,
"SaleOptOut": 1,
"SharingOptOut": 1,
"SensitiveDataProcessing": [0, 0,
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"KnownChildSensitiveDataConsents":
[0, 0],
"PersonalDataConsents": 1,
"MspaCoveredTransaction": 2,
"MspaOptOutOptionMode": 0,
"MspaServiceProviderMode": 0,
"GpcSegmentType": 1, "Gpc": True,
}
}


A.5 Notes on Reusability
You can use your own set of sites to crawl with the GPC web crawler and GPP string to decode with 
the GPP String decoder.
